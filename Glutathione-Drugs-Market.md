The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and the growing geriatric population are expected to further propel market demand over the coming years.</p> <p>According to market research, the global glutathione drugs market size was valued at approximately $500 million in 2023 and is projected to reach around $900 million by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% from 2024 to 2032.
